I want to get back to the basics of programming before attempting web 3 development again. 
This is my first project so far that I will add to over time. 
I have always enjoyed learning about language and cultures from around the world so I decided to make a game.

This is a simple idea I came up with to help me study Japanese and focus on the most important words and phrases. 
With this I can enjoy learning more Japanese and Programming at the same time.

My hopes are to add to this games library of words and phrases and also 
move onto the front end to make it more fun and interactive.
