I want to get back to the basics of programming before attempting web 3 development again. 
This is my first project so far that I will add to over time. 
I have always enjoyed learning about language and cultures from around the world so I decided to make a game.

This is a simple idea I came up with to help me study Japanese and focus on the most important words and phrases. 
With this I can enjoy learning more Japanese and Programming at the same time.

My hopes are to add to this games library of words and phrases over time while learning more about Full-stack Development.

To run game: 
             1. Open a terminal and start the Flask backend:
                python main.py (Starts Flask backend (port 5000))

             2. Open a second terminal and start the frontend server:
                python -m http.server 8000 (Starts frontend (port 8000))

             3. Open your browser and go to:
                http://127.0.0.1:8000/
